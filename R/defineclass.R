#' Class gcprofile
#'
#' This is a class representation grouping different outputs from \code{getGroups} function
#'
#' @slot data Data frame from \code{NormalizeBetweenFiles} function
#' @slot profile Data frame with compounds classified as "Profile".
#'  List of CAS numbers associated to a list of proposed names.
#' @slot nonConstitutiveFreq Data frame with compounds classified as "Non Constitutive by Frequency".
#'  List of CAS numbers associated to a list of proposed names.
#' @slot nonConstitutiveQual Data frame with compounds classified as "Non Constitutive by Quality".
#'  List of CAS numbers associated to a list of proposed names.
#' @slot areas Data frame with CAS and areas of each CAS
#' @slot quals Data frame with CAS and qualities of each CAS
#' @slot AuxTable Data frame with CAS numbers associated to their areas and qualities in each file.
#'  Data presented is the result of the consensus reached by NormalizeWithinFiles and NormalizeBetweenFiles.
